# Timpuri-Noi-pe-Drumuri-Vechi---Database
The project "Timpuri Noi on Old Roads" was created for the 12th grade final computer science certification (Atestat) and entered in the Adfaber-sponsored EDB StartUP competition in 2024. It tackles the problem of heavy traffic at one of Bucharest's busiest intersections, Timpuri Noi. The project suggests an IT solution to enhance traffic light synchronization at this crucial intersection that connects two city districts and major neighborhoods. It is motivated by a team member's everyday experiences in the area and is backed by fictitious data.

The project entails creating an interactive web application, designing a relational database, and analyzing pedestrian and traffic flow. The database, which I wrote mostly in SQL, monitors traffic lights, waiting times, and light changes for pedestrians and vehicles. By adjusting the timing of traffic lights and identifying peak hours, we demonstrated a noticeable reduction in red-light violations and an overall improvement in traffic fluidity.

The final platform includes real-time statistics and an interactive map highlighting areas in need of infrastructure improvement.
