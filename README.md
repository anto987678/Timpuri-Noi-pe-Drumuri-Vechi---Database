# Timpuri-Noi-pe-Drumuri-Vechi---Database
Timpuri Noi on Old Roads is a 12th-grade Atestat project entered in the 2024 EDB StartUP contest. It proposes an IT system to ease traffic at Bucharest’s crowded Timpuri Noi junction. Using a SQL-based database, interactive web app, and flow analysis, it shows how better light timing can cut delays and improve circulation.
